## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, slightly desaturated violet (#A080FF) to convey creativity and innovation. This is a good fit because violet is often associated with imagination and artistic pursuits. In HSL this is (257, 100%, 75%), then desaturated by about half.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated violet (#1A1329). It provides a sleek and modern feel, allowing the content to stand out. It creates a sophisticated backdrop for the primary and accent colors.
- Accent color: An analogous blue (#80BFFF), slightly brighter, to highlight interactive elements and calls to action. Its close relationship to violet on the color wheel ensures harmony while providing necessary contrast. It suggests trustworthiness and forward thinking.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif. A great fit given the futuristic, tech-oriented aesthetic. This font will provide impact and modernity to titles, logos, and highlighted sections. Recommended body text is 'Inter'.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Ensures excellent readability for descriptions, instructions, and user interface elements.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for navigation and action buttons. The icons should be designed with consistent stroke weight and style, and the set as a whole should maintain a geometric and modern aesthetic. When icons communicate functionality such as download or delete, those meanings should be universally clear.
- Employ a floating, pill-shaped container for the main navigation bar, ensuring it remains fixed at the top of the viewport for easy access. Utilize full-width sections for key areas like the Hero section, Footer, and Gallery Grid, creating a seamless and immersive user experience.
