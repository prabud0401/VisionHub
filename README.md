## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A Google account to create a Firebase project.

### **Step 1: Create and Configure Your Firebase Project**

This application requires a Firebase project with several services enabled.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Click **"Add project"** and follow the on-screen instructions.

2.  **Enable Authentication:**
    - In your new project, go to **Build > Authentication**.
    - Click **"Get started"**.
    - On the **Sign-in method** tab, enable the following providers:
        - **Email/Password**
        - **Google**

3.  **Enable Firestore Database:**
    - Go to **Build > Firestore Database**.
    - Click **"Create database"**.
    - Start in **Production mode**.
    - Choose a location for your database (e.g., `us-central`).
    - Click **"Enable"**.

4.  **Enable Firebase Storage:**
    - Go to **Build > Storage**.
    - Click **"Get started"**.
    - Follow the prompts to set up your storage bucket. You can use the default security rules for now.

### **Step 2: Install Project Dependencies**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd VisionHub-Ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### **Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables**

This project requires Firebase credentials to connect to your backend services.

1.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project.

2.  **Set up Firebase Client-Side Keys:**
    - Go to your Firebase Project Settings > General.
    - Under "Your apps," find your web app. If one doesn't exist, create one.
    - Under "SDK setup and configuration," select "Config."
    - Copy the configuration values into your `.env` file like this:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...:web:...
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase Admin (Server-Side) Key:**
    - Go to your Firebase Project Settings > Service accounts.
    - Click "Generate new private key" and save the JSON file securely.
    - **Do not commit this file to Git.** Open the downloaded JSON file, copy its entire content, and paste it into your `.env` file for the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` variable. It must be a single line.

    ```env
    # This must be the full JSON content, escaped for a single line if necessary.
    FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type": "service_account", "project_id": ...}
    ```
    
4. **Set Admin Secret Code**
    - This is a secret password you create for accessing the admin panel.
    ```env
    ADMIN_SECRET_CODE=YourSuperSecretAdminPassword123
    ```

### **Step 4: Running the Application**

Once your environment variables are set, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Admin Access

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9002/admin`.
2. Log in using:
   - **Email:** `prabud0401@gmail.com`
   - **Secret Code:** The value you set for `ADMIN_SECRET_CODE` in your `.env` file.
